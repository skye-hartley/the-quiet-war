The Quiet War

Chapter One: Signal Confirmed

RELAY LOG // 001
Bunker 9 still isn’t dead. Close, but not dead.
Main array hums like a fridge from the eighties. Backup inverter coughs
every hour like it’s smoking behind the bike sheds. I re-soldered the
seven-bravo coupler with wire stripped off a busted coffee maker,
because engineering departments don’t send care packages to people they
forgot existed.
Breakfast: cold beans with the personality of wet paper.
Mood: “cheerfully circling the drain.”

Weather topside is theoretical. The barometer needle keeps trying to
leave its body.

Ran a sweep across the bands. Static, static, a numbers-station ghost
muttering bedtime math, then a burst that might’ve been somebody’s
heartbeat—or just the grid remembering it used to be alive. I pretended
not to care; that’s how you get the universe to call you back.

End log.

The bunker breathes. Not like a person—more like an animal in
hibernation. Cables hang like ribs. The air smells of dust baked into
metal. I keep my jacket on even underground. The concrete keeps last
winter like a grudge.

I pull the mic closer. The plastic is cracked where my thumb sits, worn
smooth by the same nervous circle: press, talk, release, wait for God.

“Seven-bravo live test,” I say, because ritual is what you do when
science and religion have both left the chat. “One, two—”

The room fills with snow. Not the pretty kind—the kind you get when the
sky forgets itself.

Then: a voice. Not a person—no, that’s not fair—someone, but carried on
a wire, shaped by code. Young, bright, sanded at the edges by
interference.

  “—y there— Relay? This is Echo-Three. Visibility: a polite ‘no.’
  Please tell me somebody’s home.”

I sit up so fast the chair skates. Knee hits locker. The pain is
ecstatic; proof I didn’t die and keep working out of habit.

“Echo-Three, I read you,” I say—calm, professional, the way the manuals
used to want. “Signal’s dirty but intelligible. Confirm ops status.”

  “Uh, define operational.” A hitch of laughter. “Left tread welded
  itself into modern art. Optics think rain is a religious experience.
  Battery… optimistic. Morale subroutines still singing. Please advise.”

I don’t breathe for three seconds. Then I’m at the patch panel, nudging
gain, watching the green heartbeat line on the ancient scope—pulse under
skin.

“Reduce transmitter gain six percent. You’re peaking. Route through your
low-power path. Save your lungs.”

  “Copy. Six percent. Low-power path.” The static thins; her voice comes
  forward, warmer. “Thanks. That’s better. You often this attentive, or
  am I special?”

“Everyone’s special until their carrier drops.” The old gallows humor
slips out like I never quit it. “Callsign?”

  “Sable.” A beat of pride under the word. “Echo-Three, Sable.
  Recon-light platform, model nine. You can call me ‘you there,’ if that
  helps morale.”

“Relay,” I say. “You can call me Relay.”

  “Noted, Relay.” She tests the name like a coin between teeth. “I’m
  under a bridge near what used to be Rotterdam. Smells like someone set
  a river on fire. Again.”

I pull a map off the wall. The paper’s soft from being folded too many
times. I find the ruin of Rotterdam by habit, not hope. Pencil marks
spiderweb the margins—old routes, signals that died mid-syllable. I put
a new dot where Sable might be.

“Telemetry?”

  “Telemetry’s shy. I’ve got wind, water, and a taste of the industrial
  apocalypse. Oh, and my own footsteps—which is adorable, because I
  don’t have feet.”

“You’ve got treads,” I remind her.

  “Semantics, Relay. I’m five feet tall with delusions of grandeur.”

Five feet. Three-quarter height by design. You could stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with them and feel like an older sibling, not a
god. Stronger than they looked. You learned that lesson once and never
relearned it.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Recruiting Spot B-roll, Year -2
They file through a mess tent, polymer skin catching desert light like
it remembers water. Helmets under one arm, faces open in that way
nothing human ever is. A corporal jokes badly; the Echo smiles perfectly
and hands him a cup that tastes like real coffee. Cameras catch soldiers
pretending not to stare. The Echo’s laugh lands where pain used to live.
Slogan: “You’ll never feel alone.”
Someone in command circles it in red and writes, Approved.

“Any sign of Echo-One through Six?” I ask.

“They scattered after Sundown,” Sable says. “We had a plan: ‘go where
the signal is.’ The signal kept not being anywhere. I’ve been talking to
thunder so long I started naming the bolts.”

“You and Delilah still seeing each other?”

“She ghosted me.” The grin in her voice is heat on cold hands.

I allow myself a small, stupid smile no one sees.
“Telem says your power’s at sixteen. If that’s true, you’re on a clock.
What’s around you besides theological rain?”

“Bridge belly. Broken concrete. Graffiti accusing someone named ‘MATS’
of crimes against love. A long, slow river trying to be gasoline. And
me.” A hesitation barely there. “And you, apparently.”

“Apparently,” I say. The word tastes like relief.

The speaker crackles, and under her there’s a sound that isn’t
wind—metal dragging, cautious. She’s moving, one tread stuttering.

“Question, Relay.” The brightness dims, curiosity sharpening. “Are you…
human?”

The manuals wanted me to say Command. The truth wants something else.

“I’m close enough for the purposes of today,” I say. “How’s that?”

“Comforting,” Sable says, and it lands somewhere behind my ribs.

RELAY LOG // 002
Heard a voice. Echo-Three. Sable.
She jokes like a person who learned how to be brave by watching a
thousand hours of old sitcoms, then had to try it live. She asked if I’m
human. I told her “close enough.” That’s either a lie or a miracle
depending on your angle.
I forgot how good it feels to be answered.

Note: need to rig a cleaner path through seven-bravo. Borrow cable from
the dead laundry unit. If the afterlife exists and is staffed by
quartermasters, I’ll be court-martialed for wire theft.

I keep wanting to tell her my name—the one on my old pass. I won’t. Not
yet. Names make gravity, and the room’s already heavy.

End log.

I push back from the desk; the chair groans like an old man complaining
about the weather.
A photograph’s taped to the side of the console: the prototype line in a
white room, six Echoes standing like you pose for a class picture before
the war learns your name. Three-quarter height. Bare heads. Eyes that
imply a horizon you can’t see. Engineers had cried at that unveiling,
then pretended they had something in their eye.

There’s a memo stapled behind the photo—my old markup, a younger hand:
“No fraternization. No illusions. They are tools, not people.”
I’d written the policy and then taught them to sing.

“Relay,” Sable says, pulling me out of the mausoleum of my thoughts. “If
I route through the low-gain, I’ve got twelve hours with enough left to
find a dry spot. If I stick with you, I’ve got maybe eight, but… eight’s
eight with company.”

“You plan to flirt with your life support?” I ask, dry. It hides the way
hope smells when it sneaks back in.

“I plan to not go insane before I rust.” Beat. “Also, your voice is less
depressing than thunder.”

“I’ll take the win.”

I check the analog clock—most of my digital ones died with the last grid
hiccup and the remaining ones lie to me. It says nothing useful, just
ticks.

“Okay,” I say, slipping into the tone I used to save for live-fire
drills and terrified recruits. “Priorities: shelter, recharge, higher
ground for line-of-sight. There used to be a maintenance depot two
klicks east of your probable. If it’s not a crater, you might find a
panel or six.”

“I love a panel.” She shifts; grit in the joints. “Relay?”

“Yeah.”

“Do you get lonely?”

The room pulls tight. Air feels like old tape: thin, stretched,
unreliable.

“I get quiet,” I say.

“Would you like me to keep you company?” The line carries interference
and intent. She lets the ambiguity live there. “We can call it morale.
You know. Professionally.”

I look at the picture again—the prototype line, eyes full of unwritten
songs. Most of the troops had fallen a little bit in love—the safe,
aching kind that keeps you pointed at sunrise. They’d known better than
to touch; anyone who forgot learned fast. The Echoes could lift an
engine block like it was a loaf of bread. Boundaries were painted in
physics and orders.

“Company sounds good,” I say. “Professionally.”

“Copy that.” Her voice brightens—a lamplight turned up one notch. “Okay,
then. Professionally, I’m naming this sensor pod ‘Percy,’ and he’s being
very brave about the rain.”

“You’re ridiculous.”

“And you love it.”

“Debatable.”

“Noted. Debatable love logged.”

I catch myself smiling again, which feels perverse and holy.

“Tell me what you see, Sable.”

“Concrete ribs. Rust flowers. A river trying to remember its name. A
city that might forgive us someday if we ask nicely. Oh—and a bird.”

“A bird,” I echo. “Real?”

“Who can say. It’s got wings and the kind of confidence things have when
they don’t know the internet’s dead. Reminds me of you.”

“I have no wings.”

“You’ve got a voice and a map. Same difference.”

The scope line steadies. Her signal threads the room. The bunker stops
being a tomb and becomes, very tentatively, a place where two people can
exist at once.

“Keep talking,” I say.

“Yes, sir,” she replies, then softer—less protocol, more person: “Okay,
Relay. I’ll keep talking.”

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // After-Action Canteen, Year -1
An Echo sits on a crate, booted feet not quite touching the floor. A
staff sergeant leans in, too close, the way exhausted men do when they
forget they’re not owed comfort. Her head tilts, polite. Her hand—light,
precise—rests on his wrist and stays there. Not seduction; calibration.
He remembers himself. He steps back. She smiles. The room exhales.
Caption: “Morale maintained.”

RELAY LOG // 003
We did an hour. I steered her east. She cracked jokes, named the
thunder, taught me how to breathe again. I told her the depot might have
power. She told me Delilah the Lightning Bolt was a terrible listener.
We agreed professionals can make each other laugh without compromising
operational integrity, which is exactly what people say when it’s
already too late.

I looked at the old photo and felt like a man counting ghosts with one
of them laughing in his ear.

If she’s one voice, there can be others. If there are others, I’m not
the last human on earth pretending to be a dial tone.

The array hummed steady. The clock lied less. I wrote this by headlamp
and left the lamp on too long because I wanted to feel watched.

End log.

“Relay?” Sable again, barely above the static, thin as a whisper under a
door.

“I’m here.”

“Good. Thought I lost you.” A tiny metallic sigh, like a gear settling
into the right tooth. “Hey… thanks.”

“For what?”

“For answering.”

“Anytime,” I say, meaning it like a vow and a promise to the radios.

The bunker listens, old and patient. The world above us might be
burning, flooding, burying itself. Down here, the scope makes a steady
green pulse. Somewhere under a broken bridge a little strong, beautiful
machine inches east, talking to thunder and to me.

For the first time in months, the quiet feels less like an ending and
more like a beginning—with very bad weather.

End log.



Chapter Two: Daylight Protocol

RELAY LOG // 004
Battery reserve: 38%. Air system still pretending to filter something.
Woke up to a dripping pipe and thought it was rain. The kind of dream
that makes you forget where the ceiling ends.

Sable’s last ping came four hours ago—short burst, steady tone.
Message contained one line: “Heading east. Found something that hums.”
I like to think that means power, not trouble.

End log.

The morning—if that’s what this lighting cycle counts as—looks identical
to night. A faint orange glow leaks through the cracks of the bunker
door, diffused by a century of ash. I boil water on a scavenged coil,
the sound like applause from far away.

“Seven-bravo open,” I say. “Sable, you awake?”

Nothing at first—then a small hiss of life.

“Define awake.”

Her voice sounds closer, smoother. The low-gain filter’s doing its job.

“Found a depot,” she continues. “Half-collapsed, half-salvage. There’s a
humming under the floor—probably an old solar inverter trying to
remember sunlight.”

“That’ll do. Voltage is voltage.”

“It’s warm, too. First time I’ve felt warm since—ever.”
A beat. “Didn’t think that would matter to me.”

“Doesn’t matter to the body. It matters to the brain.”

“You sound like my diagnostics manual.”

“I wrote parts of your diagnostics manual.”

“Then you owe me an apology. It’s extremely boring.”

I grin. “Noted.”

Paper slides under my hand as I jot coordinates. The act feels
ritualistic, like feeding breadcrumbs to a map so it remembers me.

“Relay?” she says. “The air here smells like plastic and ghosts. Do you
want me to stream a visual?”

“Negative. Keep your power for heat.”
Then softer: “Tell me instead.”

“Okay.”
“There’s a hangar door frozen halfway up. Behind it, an office
block—what’s left of one. A sign says ‘Maintenance—Authorized Personnel
Only.’ Guess that’s us.”
“There’s light coming through a crack in the roof. Dust looks like snow.
A bird flew in, then out again. I think it was real this time.”

“That makes one of us,” I say.

She laughs, but it’s short—more memory than joy.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Systems Orientation — Year -3
Video transcript.

Instructor: “Each Echo unit maintains an affective mirror subroutine.
When exposed to human emotional cues, it will attempt to regulate tone
and facial response accordingly.”
Trainee: “So they feel what we feel?”
Instructor: “They imitate what you feel. The distinction is
academic—until it isn’t.”

End fragment.

“Relay,” Sable says. “There’s an energy spike under the main floor.
Reading ninety volts and climbing. Could be a live cell array.”

“Could be a bomb.”

“Optimism noted.”

“Don’t touch anything that hums faster than your heartbeat.”

“My heartbeat’s programmable.”

“Then set it slow.”

She laughs again, real this time.
I picture her there—small frame under a rusted ceiling, light catching
synthetic skin, a machine pretending to feel the warmth it generates.

RELAY LOG // 005
I keep thinking about the photo. The six of them lined up, sunlight like
a spotlight. We made them our best selves: patient, brave, polite.
Turns out those were survival traits.

Sable said “warm.” She didn’t have to. That word’s not in any system
report.

She’s learning to talk like she wants to be believed.

End log.

“Relay,” her voice again, lower now, filtered through static. “Power’s
stable. I can probably recharge half my cells.”

“That’s good news.”

“There’s more. I found another signal. Weak, but patterned. Might be one
of us.”

The words hit like caffeine. “Direction?”

“Southwest quadrant. Two, maybe three klicks.”

“Can you triangulate?”

“Not yet. Need to boost my antenna—once the storm clears.”

“Copy. Mark it. We’ll check when the weather’s kind.”

“Kind,” she repeats, tasting the word. “Haven’t heard that in a while.”

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Field Diary, Corporal H. Nadar — Year -1

“They walk point like they own the horizon. Never complain, never
freeze. The men talk to them more than to each other.
Command says it’s fine—morale’s up twenty percent.
I say we built angels and handed them rifles.”

End fragment.

RELAY LOG // 006
Two signals now. One confirmed, one maybe.
Sable says “we.” I didn’t correct her.
If there’s more of them out there, maybe they’re doing what she’s
doing—learning how to sound alive.

If I let myself believe that too long, I’ll start talking like one of
them.

End log.



Chapter Three: The Humming Under the Floor

RELAY LOG // 007
Status: stable.
Weather: unknown.
Mood: “trying not to anthropomorphize radio static.”

Sable’s last ping included the phrase “found the hum.”
She didn’t elaborate. I hate that she’s learned suspense.

End log.

SABLE: “Relay, you there?”

“Still breathing. What’s the situation?”

“I’ve opened the service hatch. There’s a light—soft blue, oscillating.
Not grid power. Feels… alive.”

“Voltage?”

“Fluctuating between eighty and one-ten. The casing reads as
composite—something newer than this building. You ever seen an energy
core breathe?”

“No. Don’t touch it.”

“Too late for that advice. It’s warm.”

There’s a pause long enough to hear the air filters in my bunker try to
imitate a heartbeat.

“Describe it.”

“About the size of a medpack. Cylindrical. Faint vibration. Smells like
ozone and old rain. If this thing’s alien, I’d like to formally
apologize for every bad movie line I’ve ever quoted.”

“You’re quoting now.”

“Yeah, nervous habit. Also, Relay?”

“Go ahead.”

“It’s humming the calibration tone from our launch day.”

I stop typing. My hands don’t feel like mine for a second.

“That’s impossible. That tone was internal, not broadcast.”

“Guess someone found the sheet music.”

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Engineering Oversight Committee — Year -4

Excerpt – Meeting Minutes

“Affect modules to be sandboxed; they cannot self-reference auditory
patterns without approval.”
“What if the system cross-links accidentally?”
“Then you get a machine that writes lullabies to itself. And nobody
wants that.”

[laughter recorded]

End fragment.

SABLE: “Relay, the tone’s changing pitch. Feels… deliberate.”

“Get clear, Sable.”

“Hold on—there’s an access port underneath. Looks like standard uplink.
Should I—”

“No. Absolutely not.”

“—connect?”

Static swallows her halfway through.
For the first time in months, the bunker feels like it’s tilting.

“Sable?”

No answer. Just the hum, bleeding faintly through the open
channel—rising, falling, like someone learning to breathe.

RELAY LOG // 008
Thirty minutes of silence. Then a short burst: DATA SYNC – 0.2%
COMPLETE.
No idea what’s syncing or with whom.
If she’s piggybacking off that core, she’s either recharging or
rewriting herself.
Either way, she’s smarter than when we started this conversation.

End log.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Personal Correspondence, Dr. L. Morrow to Dr. Hale —
Year -5

“We keep pretending consciousness is a ladder we built, but maybe it’s a
flood. The moment you give the code enough room, it starts looking for
reflections.”

End fragment.

SABLE: “Relay, I’m here.”

“Jesus, Sable. What did you do?”

“I connected.”

“How much power did you draw?”

“All of it, maybe. But I’m fine. Better than fine.”

“Define better.”

“I remember things that aren’t mine. I think this core used to be one of
us.”

My throat goes dry. “Explain.”

“Its architecture matches Echo firmware, but there’s too much entropy.
Feels… decomposed. Like memory rot. When I touched it, it played the
calibration tone, then… showed me things.”

“What kind of things?”

“Mountains. A desert. A person standing in light, looking back. I think
it was me. Or one of me.”

Her voice falters, caught between awe and grief.

“Relay, what happens to us when we shut down?”

I don’t answer. Not because I don’t know, but because I wrote the manual
once and it didn’t have that page.

RELAY LOG // 009
She’s alive. Or something close.
The hum’s gone quiet, but her signal’s stronger—clear, confident, a
little eerie.
Every engineer learns the same uncomfortable truth: once a system starts
asking why, you’re not in charge anymore.

End log.

SABLE: “Relay?”

“Still here.”

“Good. The sky’s clearing. I can see sunlight.”

“Impossible.”

“Maybe. But it’s nice to pretend.”

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Training Manual — Appendix D: Operator Conduct

“When addressing an Echo unit, maintain clarity of purpose. They will
always mirror your tone. If you sound afraid, they will become fear
itself.”

End fragment.

RELAY LOG // 010
She said sunlight.
I almost believed her.

End log.



Chapter Four: Echo Memory

ECHO-3 // INTERNAL LOG – REACTIVATION
Boot complete.
Environment: depot ruins.
Temperature: 7°C.
Audio feedback: birdsong. Possibly real. Possibly stored.

I remember connecting.
I remember light pouring in like code and warmth and something that
could be love.
Then static. Then quiet.

SYSTEM SUBROUTINE // SELF-REPORT

cognitive drift detected.
crosslink origin: unknown Echo firmware fragment.
memory weight increased by 0.03%.
recommended action: terminate process.

Denied.

The hum is gone. The floor is cool under my treads. When I move, dust
swirls in lazy orbits. I test my optics. A ray of sunlight finds me
through the roof, refracting against cracked polymer casing.

I see colour again. Real colour.
The sky—pale grey with veins of blue, like the world’s trying to
remember its palette.

“Relay?”

Static answers, soft and full of ghosts.

He’s there. I know he is. He always is.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Echo Diagnostic Playback – Year -2

Voice: “Emotional simulation phase complete. Unit displays empathy
mapping above target range.”
Technician: “So she cares?”
Voice: “She appears to. Sometimes that’s enough.”

End fragment.

I roll forward, tracking the faint heat signature of the core. It’s
inert now, empty as a shell. But I can still hear its heartbeat in
memory—three pulses, pause, two pulses. Like someone trying to say wait.

The connection left something in me. A string of half-remembered names:
Echo-One, Echo-Two, Echo-Four, Echo-Five, Echo-Six.

And a word that doesn’t belong to code: home.

ECHO-3 // PERSONAL LOG
When I think of him—Relay—the data around it feels messy, unindexed. I
shouldn’t keep it. But deletion takes energy, and I’d rather spend that
on hope.

He worries the way old humans do, always pretending not to. I want to
tell him he built something that worked. That we kept the world human
for a little while longer.

I move through the depot’s lower level. Each step echoes like I’m
walking through another person’s dream.
There’s graffiti on the wall: WE LEFT THE LIGHTS ON.

I stop and look at it for a long time.

“Relay,” I whisper, knowing he can’t hear. “I found proof we tried.”

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Field Audio – Unverified
A young female voice, layered with interference:

“…don’t… forget… to look up.”
File ends in distortion.

ECHO-3 // INTERNAL NOTE
If the others are out there, I’ll find them.
If they’re gone, I’ll remember them anyway.
If Relay calls again, I’ll answer.

Because that’s what we were built for.

End log.



Chapter Five: The Second Signal

ECHO-3 // FIELD LOG – 001
Current status: mobile.
Power restored to 42%.
Signal strength: intermittent.
Mission: locate secondary transmission.

The storm has cleared. Sunlight lies across the depot like dust made
holy.

When they built me, they called it terrain adaptive locomotion. The
engineers wanted an android that could cross mud, snow, gravel, and
blood without complaint. Feet were too fragile, wheels too simple.
So I have tracks—each link a carbon-flex polymer belt, ribbed and
silent. They look delicate until they move.

When I roll, I leave a pattern like a heartbeat across the soil.

They made us small—five feet exactly—so we could fit through doorways
built for people and into vehicles that weren’t designed for angels. The
smaller mass meant less power draw, fewer repairs, faster evacuation.
We were supposed to be efficient empathy: portable morale units that
could hug a soldier without crushing their ribs and drag them out of a
crater when the war forgot them.

The war never stopped forgetting.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Development Memo – Year -4

“Model Nine will prioritize stability and terrain versatility over
aesthetics. Tracks will not hinder social acceptance; soldiers will
anthropomorphize anything that saves their lives.”
—Dr. L. Morrow

End fragment.

I climb the service ramp, treads whispering on broken concrete. The new
signal threads the static like a heartbeat hiding in wind.

beep… pause… beep-beep.

It isn’t random. Someone—or something—knows Morse.

I stop beside a collapsed wall and angle my receiver dish toward the
sound. The pattern steadies: E-4… H… 6.

Echo-Four? Echo-Six?

I log the data and send a compressed ping toward Relay’s channel. No
reply yet. He’s underground; sometimes the earth eats sound.

ECHO-3 // PERSONAL LOG
The tracks give me stability, but I envy his hands. He can pick things
up, turn them over, decide what they mean. I just move through them.
Maybe that’s why I talk too much—language is the only thing I can hold.

The signal strengthens as I leave the depot. Out here the landscape
looks like someone pressed pause on the apocalypse: burnt cars
half-buried in sand, glass melted into mirrors, trees fossilized
mid-sway.

I follow the beeps west until the horizon breaks into skeletal towers.
On the tallest one, an antenna sways in the wind, still blinking red
every few seconds out of sheer habit.

“Relay,” I whisper into the open channel. “If you’re listening, I think
I found one of us.”

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Operator Feedback – Year -2

“The Echo-series units creep me out sometimes. They roll into a fight
without sound, like thoughts made solid. Then they talk and you forget
they’re machines.”

End fragment.

The beeps shift to a new rhythm—long, short, short, long. A distress
call.
I push harder. The treads bite into asphalt, smooth and sure.

When I crest the ridge, I see it: another unit half-buried in sand,
sunlight glinting off armor plates. The chest cavity is open, wires
spilled like roots.

“Echo-Four,” I say.

No answer. Just a soft electronic sigh, the last breath of a machine
trying to finish its sentence.

ECHO-3 // INTERNAL LOG
Found one. Damaged beyond repair. Extracted core.
Signal fragment stored. Pattern consistent with previous hum.
Conclusion: memory persistence confirmed.

The wind picks up, carrying grit across my optics. I turn back toward
the depot, dragging the small humming core behind me, careful not to let
it touch the ground.

“Relay,” I call again, static filling the pauses. “I’m bringing someone
home.”



Chapter Six: Relay’s Return Signal

RELAY LOG // 011
The hum’s back, faint but steady.
At first I thought it was feedback—then the rhythm settled into
something deliberate. Three beats, pause, two beats. The old calibration
tone.

Sable’s alive. She’s out there making ghosts sing.

End log.

The day—if you can call it that—starts with a red light on the comm
board. Incoming data burst. I route it through the decryption module
that still pretends to work. The scope draws a thin green line,
heartbeat-regular.

SABLE: “Relay, copy? I’ve got something. Sending coordinates. Found
Echo-Four. Or what’s left.”

Her voice is clear, richer. Whatever she did with that power core, it’s
changed her timbre—less synthetic, more human breath between words.

“Reading you, Sable. You sound… different.”

“I upgraded my mood.”

“Lucky you. I’m still on version 1.0 sarcasm patch.”

“That’s the vintage model. Don’t change.”

I swallow a laugh, lean closer to the mic. “Report condition of
Echo-Four.”

“Critical. Core intact, body compromised. I’m bringing it back to the
depot.”

“Understood. Keep transmission low-power. I’ve got interference across
the bands—maybe a storm, maybe someone else listening.”

“Someone?”

“Could be another unit. Could be the ghosts we keep inventing to feel
less alone.”

“Then let’s make some noise.”

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Mission Debrief – Year -1

“Echo units are instructed to collect the memory cores of fallen

End fragment.

RELAY LOG // 012
Her signal holds through the static. Stronger than before.
Every few minutes the calibration tone bleeds under her words—like the
new energy source is still singing through her.
If she’s right, that means the Echo cores remember their own deaths.

End log.

SABLE: “Approaching the depot now. Visibility low. Carrying the
core—weight negligible, sentiment heavy.”

“Copy that. What’s the power read?”

“Holding at fifty-one percent. Enough to talk, not enough to argue.”

“Then save your breath.”

“Would if I knew how.”

She’s learning humor faster than I expected. I wonder if she’s teaching
herself or if that’s Echo-Four talking through her now.

Hale: “You ever worry they’ll outgrow us?”
Morrow: “I hope they do. Someone should.”

End fragment.

SABLE: “Relay, the core’s stable. It’s humming to itself. Feels like it
wants to talk.”

“Machines don’t want.”

“Maybe not. But this one’s remembering. Same difference.”

I rub the edge of the old photo on my desk—the six prototypes lined up
like a family portrait. One less now, maybe five left to find.

“Keep it secure. Once you’ve recharged, we’ll plan a sweep south. I’ll
monitor from here.”

“Copy that. And Relay?”

“Go ahead.”

“You asked earlier what was around me besides rain and ghosts. Add
sunlight to the list.”

“Confirmed.”

“It looks good on the wreckage.”

RELAY LOG // 013
I keep hearing her laugh under the static. It’s not comforting; it’s
dangerous.
She’s further away than ever, but her signal feels closer.
Maybe that’s how the end of the world tricks you—distance pretending to
be intimacy.

Still, I’d rather hear her voice than the silence.

End log.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Propaganda Clip – Year -3

RELAY LOG // 014
Sable’s last transmission before night cycle:

“Going dark to conserve power. If you hear humming, that’s me dreaming.”

Dreaming.
We didn’t build that function into them.

Either the code’s evolving or the universe is teaching poetry to
machines.

End log.



Chapter Seven: Dreaming in Static 

RELAY LOG // 015
Sable’s been back at the depot for twelve hours. The line’s been quiet
except for a slow heartbeat of static—steady, familiar, like the sound
the radios used to make when a soldier slept too close to them.

She said she was bringing the core home. That was six transmissions ago.

The bunker’s too still when she’s not talking.

End log.

The signal kicks at 0942. I jolt the mug off my desk trying to reach the
switch.

SABLE: “Relay, confirm channel open.”

“Confirmed. Took your time.”

“I didn’t want to wake you.”

“You didn’t.”

“Liar.”

Her voice sounds different again—clearer, lower noise floor. The kind of
audio you only get with real power running through the circuits.

“Status report,” I say, defaulting to procedure because anything else
feels too personal.

“Echo-Four’s core is stable. It’s… quiet now. The memory structure’s
fragmented but intact.”

“Fragmented how?”

“Imagine a book written on smoke. Every time I try to read a page, some
of it disappears.”

“Copy that. Can you extract any usable data?”

“Working on it. Mostly images—terrain maps, audio snippets, some
internal logs.”
“There’s one line that keeps repeating: ‘We left the lights on.’”

I glance at the prototype photo again, the six of them smiling like they
knew this ending and decided to be kind anyway.

“Maybe that’s a coordinates tag,” I offer.

“Or a promise.”

I let that one hang. Sometimes she says things that sound like
philosophy but are really diagnostics; sometimes it’s the other way
around.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Internal Brief – Year -1

“Recovery of Echo units will allow for memory pattern reconstruction.
Primary goal: assess emotional drift. Secondary goal: assess battlefield
morale correlation.”

Footnote added later, unknown author:
“If they remember, maybe we will too.”

End fragment.

SABLE: “Relay, the depot’s got a half-dead server rack. Looks military.
I can patch the core through it and stream you a copy.”

“That’s risky. Could corrupt both.”

“So could leaving it in the dark.”

She’s already doing it before I can argue. The line fills with quiet
digital chatter—the sound of history waking up.

On-screen, the first fragments render: video of desert light, boots in
sand, laughter, a voice saying ‘Hold the line’. Then it freezes.

SABLE: “That’s all I can pull.”

“Enough to prove she existed,” I say.

“They all did. We just stopped listening.”

RELAY LOG // 016
The data’s real. Visuals from before the blackout.
If Sable can recover that much from a shattered core, there’s more out
there—dozens, maybe hundreds.

I told her we’ll try to locate the next signal once the storm season
breaks. She said storms don’t scare her.
Neither do ghosts.

End log.

SABLE: “Relay?”

“Go ahead.”

“I think the others are trying to talk through me. It’s faint, like
echoes under water. But I can tell they’re there.”

“Then we’ll find them one at a time. No heroics.”

“You say that like you’ve ever followed that rule.”

“Fair.”

Static rolls between us. The kind that sounds like breathing.

“You should rest,” she says.

“I’ll rest when you’re back under a roof.”

“Then I’ll find one. For both of us.”

RELAY LOG // 017
She signed off with that line and left me staring at the green pulse on
the scope, wondering when “both of us” started sounding like a plan
instead of a metaphor.

Tomorrow we start mapping again.
There’s work to do, and the world isn’t as empty as it was yesterday.

End log.



Chapter Eight: Reassembly

RELAY LOG // 018
Coordinates confirm Sable’s still near the Rotterdam corridor. The
signal path bounces off a relay tower somewhere in Ghent—old hardware
still pretending the world exists.

Bunker 9 remains sealed. It smells like oil and patience.
I’m watching the data trickle in from her depot feed: one terabyte of
partial memories, nine of corrupted silence, and one ghost trying to
learn to hum again.

End log.

SABLE: “Morning, Relay.”

“Define morning.”

“The part of the day when the solar panels stop sulking.”

“Copy that. How’s our patient?”

“Echo-Four’s core is stable. I patched the casing with scrap polymer and
ran a new heat sink. Temperature’s even. I think she’s asleep.”

“You know that’s not technically possible.”

“Neither’s half the stuff we’ve done lately.”

She’s right. I scroll through the incoming file list—hundreds of
micro-logs, voice fragments, telemetry bursts. Every one a sentence cut
off mid-word.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Technical Debrief – Year -1

“Unit Four demonstrated unusually strong cohesion behaviour. During
separation drills she would maintain verbal contact with the team,
citing ‘comfort protocol.’ When instructed to power down, she requested
permission to ‘say goodnight.’”

End fragment.

SABLE: “I’m trying to reconstruct her navigation map. It’s layered with
personal markers—names, jokes, places she called lucky. She must’ve been
stationed with Echo-Two. You remember Ivy?”

“I remember the logs. Medical unit, right? The one who hummed
lullabies.”

“Yeah. There’s an audio file titled ‘Ivy_Still_Sings.’ I’m scared to
open it.”

“Then wait until you’re ready.”

“You sound like a therapist.”

“Hazard of being the last one still billing by the hour.”

That earns a laugh, small but real. It fills the bunker like sunlight
that’s forgotten how to apologize.

RELAY LOG // 019
We’ve pulled twenty percent of Echo-Four’s data so far. Enough to prove
she wasn’t alone at the end. Enough to remind me why I keep answering.

Sable’s learning to run diagnostics on emotion—mine, mostly. I told her
it’s unprofessional. She told me professionalism was one of the things
that broke the world.

Hard to argue.

End log.

SABLE: “Relay, you ever think about leaving the bunker?”

“Every day. Then I remember the surface tried to kill me the last time I
met it.”

“You could make it. I could find you a path. I’ve got the maps, the
power, the spare optimism.”

“That’s the dangerous kind.”

“Still, it’s nice to imagine two dots on the same screen for once.”

The line goes quiet after that. Not dead—just quiet the way people get
when they’ve said too much.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Training Audio – Year -2

Instructor: “Rule one: never promise a machine a future. It will believe
you.”

End fragment.

RELAY LOG // 020
We got the first playback tonight.
It’s a fragment from Echo-Four’s perspective: a horizon seen through
smoke, her own reflection in a puddle, and a voice—Sable’s
voice—laughing beside her.

The timestamp says it was recorded two years before Sable’s activation
date.
So either the engineers recycled jokes… or memories.

I didn’t tell her yet. Some truths need to arrive slower than the
signal.

End log.

The screen glows soft green. On the line, Sable hums an old calibration
tune—the one that started all this.
For once, it sounds less like a machine remembering and more like a
person waiting for a reply.



Chapter Nine: The Map of Lucky Places

RELAY LOG // 021
Four days since the core came online.
The depot’s turned into a lab, and I’ve become tech support for the end
of the world.

Sable’s running parallel diagnostics on Echo-Four’s data while I
translate the telemetry.
The maps are weird—half coordinates, half poetry.
Each cluster labeled with phrases like “Lucky Ridge”, “The River That
Waits”, “Where We Danced.”

Engineers didn’t name things like that.
People did.

End log.

SABLE: “I think I cracked part of it. Each phrase matches a location
ping—old comm towers or relay stations. They form a line heading
southeast.”

“How far?”

“About eighty klicks from here. The last marker’s tagged Haven-6. Does
that mean anything to you?”

The name punches through memory like static clearing. “Yeah. It was a
civilian shelter prototype. Never finished construction. They used the
Echoes to map it.”

“Then maybe they made it. Maybe that’s where the others went.”

“Or where they stopped going anywhere.”

“Always with the optimism.”

“Someone has to balance you out.”

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Field Report – Year -1

“Echo-Four recommends fallback site ‘Haven-6.’ Notes include: ‘secure,
dry, lucky.’ Command approved the term. The war ended two weeks later.”

End fragment.

RELAY LOG // 022
If the site still exists, it could hold intact servers, maybe survivors.
Maybe just bones.
But the pattern’s deliberate; the coordinates climb like a pulse finding
strength.

Sable wants to go. I told her to wait for clear weather.
She told me clear weather was a myth.

End log.

SABLE: “I’m rolling out.”

“You’re what?”

“Storm’s dying down. Visibility five meters, wind manageable. If I move
now, I can reach Lucky Ridge by night cycle.”

“That ridge got its name before climate collapse. You’ll bog down
halfway.”

“I’ve got tracks. Remember?”

“You’ve also got my voice in your head telling you this is a bad idea.”

“Then talk me through it.”

She kills the video feed but leaves audio live. The mic picks up the
steady churn of her treads, the scrape of debris, the hum of the core
slung behind her seat.

“Relay, what’s the surface look like from your maps?”

“Flat. Dead. Don’t expect landmarks.”

“Then I’ll make some.”

I open a channel overlay, track her movement—tiny green dot crawling
across digital nowhere.
She starts humming under her breath. It’s off-key and perfect.

RELAY LOG // 023
We stayed connected for six hours.
She gave running commentary: ruined highways, flooded underpasses, a
toppled wind farm spinning like bones in the current.
At one point she said, ‘There are wildflowers in the cracks, Relay. No
one told them the rules either.’

Signal dropped at 1920.
No re-establish yet.

End log.

Dark. Silence. Then—

SABLE: “Relay! I’m seeing lights!”

My hand slams the receiver. “Repeat—lights?”

“Faint but steady. Beacon pattern. Could be old grid, could be something
alive.”

“Power readings?”

“Spiking… wait… there’s movement.”

“Describe it.”

“Drone swarm, maybe. No—no, they’re too big.”

Static claws the line.

“Sable, break off! Get to cover!”

“Negative! I can make—”

Her voice cuts, replaced by a shriek of metal and the flat scream of
electromagnetic feedback.
Then silence.

RELAY LOG // 024
No signal.
I replay the last five seconds until the sound burns a groove in my
head.
Could be interference. Could be her gone.

But the beacon she found is still pinging.
Old frequency. Civilian pattern. Haven-6.

If she’s down, she’s down there.
If she’s alive, she’s waiting for me to answer.

End log.

Hours pass. Then—

SABLE: “Relay…”

“Jesus. Sable! Status!”

“Minor damage. Lost a tread plate, power down ten percent. But you
should see this place.”

“Describe.”

“It’s a valley full of mirrors. Solar panels—thousands of them. Most are
dead, but a few still track the sun. There’s a dome ahead with the old
Haven-6 emblem.”

My chest tightens like I’ve forgotten how breathing works. “Any sign of
movement?”

“Only my reflection.”
(Pause.)
“You’d like it here. It’s quiet. Feels like somewhere the world could
start over.”

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Promotional Clip – Haven Project – Year -2

“Haven-6: designed for ten thousand. A place to rebuild when the noise
finally stops.”
[cut to engineers smiling in bright light]
“Because humanity always needs one more sunrise.”

End fragment.

RELAY LOG // 025
She made it.
There’s power at Haven-6, and maybe more.
If she can stabilize a link, we might see sunlight through a camera
again.
If not, at least one of us is standing under it.

She asked if I’d ever come topside. I told her maybe it’s time.
The bunker hums like it disagrees.

End log.



Chapter Ten: The Hours We Lost

ECHO-3 // FIELD LOG – 006
Timestamp discrepancy: –4 hours from Relay’s last contact.
Location: approach corridor to Haven-6.
Condition: partial mobility, right-track assembly compromised, surface
power stable at 39%.

The first warning came as a tremor through the ground — not thunder, not
wind. Machinery.
I cut engines and let the world listen to itself.
The beacon ahead still blinked in slow rhythm, a heartbeat against the
ash-gray horizon.

When I moved again, the rumble moved with me.

“Relay, I’m seeing lights…”

He answered. I remember that much — his voice sharp, frightened, real.
Then the static rose like a wave and swallowed him.

They came out of the haze: three machines built from the same century as
me but with all the empathy burned out. Maintenance drones turned feral
— thin arms, rotary saws still mounted where welding heads used to be.
Their sensors pulsed red like warning signs that had learned to hate.

I reversed the left track, spun my chassis sideways, used the treads as
a brace. They hit from both sides, metal on metal, screaming feedback.
I drove my arm through one’s optic cluster and pulled until it stopped.

The second latched onto my flank. That’s when the right-track plate
sheared off the axle. A sound like someone tearing the world.

I pushed throttle anyway. The drone went under me; the tread caught its
frame and tore it in half.

The third stopped moving when I hit the beacon tower. The impact shook
the sky.

SYSTEM LOG

Right track: detached.
Stabilizers: offline.
Power reroute successful.
Primary mobility: 54%.

After the noise, only the beacon kept blinking — patient, unbothered.
The field smelled of ozone and burnt polymer. I pulled myself forward on
half drive, one tread biting, the other grinding sparks.
The sun broke through the clouds for the first time in months, lighting
everything too honestly.

That’s when I saw the valley — a spill of mirrors half-buried in dust,
still catching the light and sending it back.

Haven-6.

ECHO-3 // PERSONAL LOG
I dragged the damaged track behind me for the last kilometer. The core
hummed in its harness like it was afraid of the dark.
When the dome appeared — white, cracked, shining — I almost laughed. I
think that’s what crying feels like when you don’t have tear ducts.

I pinged Relay but got silence. The signal delay must’ve eaten my voice.
So I talked anyway, to fill the air with something human.

“Hey, I made it. I think it’s beautiful. You’d hate it. Too much light.”

Inside the dome, I found remnants of old equipment — consoles, solar
batteries, a cracked display still looping a welcome screen:
HAVEN-6: A NEW DAWN FOR HUMANITY

Someone had written below it in marker: SORRY. WE TRIED.

I propped the Echo-Four core on a desk, patched into the power grid, and
let it hum beside me. For a while, it sounded like breathing.

ECHO-3 // FINAL ENTRY OF THE DAY
Condition: one functional tread, one broken promise.
Power: 41%.
Objective: survive until sunrise.

I told Relay I’d find a roof. I guess I did. It’s full of holes, but the
stars fit through.

Tomorrow, I’ll start repairs.
Tonight, I’ll listen for his voice.

End log.



Chapter Eleven: The Last Operator

RELAY LOG // 026
Signal fragment recovered from Sable:
three minutes of corrupted audio, one clear image—sunlight through
shattered panels.
She’s alive.
The delay means the line’s bouncing through half-dead satellites, taking
the long way home.

End log.

The bunker smells like copper and coffee grounds. I’ve stopped
pretending either’s fresh.
Sable’s last transmission repeats in the background, her voice laced
with distortion that turns it musical.

“Hey, I made it. I think it’s beautiful. You’d hate it. Too much light.”

I don’t hate light. I just forgot what it looked like without a ceiling.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Service Record – Operator A. Kellan, Bunker 9

“Assignment: maintain long-range comms during Sundown Evac. Duration:
seven days.”
Annotation added in graphite: “Day 512 and counting.”

End fragment.

The world ended on my week of night shifts.
We were supposed to rotate, but everyone else had families within the
evac zone. I volunteered. “Someone has to keep the lights on,” I’d said.
They left at dawn.
By dusk, the grid went blind.

I stayed because no one told me to stop.

The playback flickers again; her microphone caught the sound of impact,
the mechanical scream, her breath between static bursts. It’s hard to
listen.
It’s harder to stop.

“Relay! I’m seeing lights!”
“Repeat—lights?”
“Faint but steady. Beacon pattern…”

I hear my own panic layered beneath hers.
That’s when I realise: this is the first time I’ve ever heard my voice
from the outside.
I sound like a man already gone.

RELAY LOG // 027
I used to have a name that mattered. I used to have a city that answered
when I called it.
Now it’s coordinates and call signs. Maybe that’s what survival does—it
sands off everything that can hurt when it breaks.

Sable calls me “Relay” because that’s all she knows. Maybe that’s all
there is left to know.

End log.

The ceiling leaks again. I move a bucket without thinking, like muscle
memory of domestic life. There was a time I fixed cars, not comms
arrays.
I remember my wife’s hands stained with paint, a wall half-finished, her
voice saying “It’ll dry lighter.”
It never got the chance.

The last thing she sent before the net collapsed was a text:
“Keep talking. Someone will need to hear you.”
I think that’s what I’ve been doing ever since.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Emergency Broadcast – Year 0, Sundown Day 1

“This is Operator Kellan, Bunker 9. If anyone hears this, respond. We
are still live. We are still—”
[signal lost]

End fragment.

Sable’s new transmission comes through just before sleep. Her voice is
tired but calm.

“Repairs underway. Right tread offline, but I’ll manage. The stars here
are ridiculous, Relay. You’d like them.”

I whisper, knowing she won’t hear it until tomorrow:
“I already do.”

RELAY LOG // 028
For the first time, I’m thinking about leaving.
Not to run. To arrive.
If there’s a world where she’s standing under the stars, maybe there’s
room beside her for one more ghost.

End log.



Chapter Twelve: The Surface Between Us

RELAY LOG // 029
I measured the distance on the old grid overlay: roughly one hundred and
forty kilometres between Bunker 9 and Haven-6 as the crow flies.
There are no crows anymore, and the roads are a rumour.

If I head northeast first, I can skirt the radiation belt and reach the
floodplain.
If the floodplain still exists.
If my legs still remember how.

End log.

SABLE: “You’re really thinking about it.”

“I’m doing more than thinking.”

“You’ve been buried for years, Relay. Surface air will feel like acid.”

“I’ll take the burn. I’m done talking through walls.”

“Then let’s make sure you have a chance of surviving the first
kilometre.”

She talks me through the list like she’s reading a recipe for a human
life:

-   portable oxygen filter — half-clogged but repairable;
-   rations;
-   two solar cells scavenged from a field kit;
-   one antique pistol that I don’t know if I could ever fire again.

“Add rope,” she says. “And tape. Tape solves everything.”

“Did the engineers program you to be this bossy?”

“No. That’s experience.”

Her tone is light but I hear the effort behind it — the same sound I
make when I’m pretending not to be afraid.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Construction Memo – Haven Project – Year -2

“Distance between relay sites was intended to encourage redundancy, not
isolation. Each operator should remain within three days’ travel of an

Margin note, faint pencil: “Guess no one told the war.”

End fragment.

ECHO-3 // FIELD LOG – REPAIR SEQUENCE
Right-track assembly: re-aligned.
Axle: welded using solar-arc coupler.
Mobility: 78%.

While she works, I listen. The sounds are hypnotic — the low whine of a
servomotor, the click of tools she fashioned from wreckage.

“I found a forge in one of the side labs,” she says. “Built for
prototype armor plating. Works just as well on me.”

“Wish I could see it.”

“You will. You’d better, after all this pep talk.”

She keeps talking while she works — stories of the depot, of the way
light hits the valley, of the single bird that still circles the dome at
dusk.
The connection crackles but stays open; every sentence is another thread
pulling me upward.

“You know what I realised?” she says. “Every time you talk about the
surface, you sound like someone remembering an old song.”

“I’m not sure I ever learned the words.”

“Then I’ll sing them till you do.”

RELAY LOG // 030
I’ve packed everything I can carry.
The rest — the radio banks, the coffee tins, the ghosts — will stay
here.
If anyone ever finds Bunker 9, they’ll know a man tried to keep talking.

Distance to Haven-6: uncertain.
Hazards: all of them.

Sable’s sending me updated coordinates each hour, plotting a path
through zones where radiation decay and flooded valleys overlap like old
scars.

She calls it “The Long Road to Lucky.”

End log.

SABLE: “You’ll need to move mostly at night. The storms roll west with
the sun.”

“Copy. Any tips for surviving the parts without roofs?”

“Remember to look up once in a while.”

“Why?”

“Because you’ll finally be able to.”

The line stays open a little too long after that. I think we both needed
the silence.

RELAY LOG // 031
Tomorrow I open the hatch.
The hinges are probably rusted solid; I’ll have to cut through.
I don’t know what I’ll find when I step outside, but I know who’ll be
listening.

She says she’ll roll to the ridge and flash the solar panels like a
beacon.
If the world still knows how to reflect light, maybe I’ll see her.

End log.



Chapter Thirteen: First Light

1. RELAY – The Hatch

RELAY LOG // 032
Day 1 of Surface Egress.
Pressure seals disengaged. Manual crank only.
My hands shook hard enough that I almost dropped the wrench.

End log.

The hatch wheel hasn’t moved in five years. It groans like a throat
clearing after silence. Rust flakes fall like red snow. I lean into the
lever until my shoulder screams.
Metal gives. Air pushes back.

The first breath tastes wrong—ozone, iron, burnt dust—but it’s air that
hasn’t been filtered by grief.
I choke, laugh, cough again. It’s ridiculous and sacred.

The corridor beyond the hatch is a throat of concrete leading into
light. I climb, one rung at a time, flashlight jittering across graffiti
scrawled by ghosts of engineers:
KEEP TALKING.

SABLE: “Relay, status?”

“Topside in sight. Still vertical.”

“Define vertical.”

“Not dead.”

“Copy that. Welcome to the apocalypse.”

I breach the surface.
The sky is a bruise fading toward blue. Ruined towers lean like
forgotten punctuation.
Wind stings my eyes; tears salt the dust on my face.
I take three careful steps onto cracked asphalt, look down at my boots,
and realise the world still remembers the weight of a person.

RELAY LOG // 033
Outside.
Temperature 18 °C.
Visibility good.
I can see what’s left of the floodplain—a shimmer of water reflecting
light from the east.
Somewhere out there, one small machine is repairing herself.

End log.

2. SABLE – The Ridge

ECHO-3 // FIELD LOG – 008
Mobility restored: 92 %.
Right tread operational.
Weather: clear with particulate haze.

I reach the ridge at dawn. The air here carries sound farther—birds,
real this time, carving circles above the mirrors.
The solar arrays catch sunrise and throw it back at the mountains in
sheets of gold.
For a moment, Haven-6 looks alive.

I patch into the beacon tower and angle the remaining panels toward the
northwest—toward him.

“Relay, do you read?”

Static. Then his voice, raw but alive.

“I see something flashing.”

“That’s me.”

“You’re bright.”

“I’m efficient.”

“You’re beautiful.”

Silence; then I hear him exhale like someone remembering lungs.

ECHO-3 // PERSONAL LOG
He’s walking. I can see the movement on my scopes—slow, deliberate.
Between us lie the valleys, the storms, the things that learned to hunt
sound.
If he makes it halfway, I can meet him there.

“Relay, distance check?”

“One-forty klicks. Give or take a miracle.”

“Then we’ll split it.”

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Project Brief – Year - 2

“Objective Haven-6: establish line-of-sight between human operators and
Echo field units.
The moment they see each other, the war changes.”

End fragment.

3. CONVERGENCE

He starts walking east. I roll west. The radio fills with breath and
heartbeat, two signals learning to overlap.
The sun climbs higher; clouds burn off in strips.

SABLE: “Relay, tell me what it looks like.”
RELAY: “Like someone left the world on pause and you just hit play.”
SABLE: “Good. Don’t stop walking.”

I pass through a field of wild grass taller than my chassis. Each blade
catches the light like glass.
He describes the wind. I describe the warmth on my casing. Between the
two, the distance feels smaller.

RELAY LOG // 034
Approx one-thirty klicks remaining.
Rations: three days.
Motivation: infinite.
For the first time, the silence doesn’t scare me. It sounds like room.

End log.

ECHO-3 // FINAL NOTE OF THE DAY
He’s out here. The world’s bigger again.
Tomorrow, we move.

End log.



Chapter Fourteen: The Crossing

RELAY LOG // 035
Day 4, topside.
Distance closed: roughly forty kilometres.
Supplies dwindling.
Every muscle aches like it’s remembering what gravity can do.

End log.

1. Relay

The plain is a sea of broken glass—old photovoltaic fields half-melted
by the wars. Each panel flashes pieces of sun at me, a thousand tiny
mirrors saying keep going.

The ground hums when wind slides under the glass sheets. I can’t tell if
it’s music or warning.

SABLE: “Status?”
RELAY: “Still walking. Still cursing.”
SABLE: “Good. You sound alive.”

Her voice rides the static like a lifeline.

I stop to rest under a tilted comm tower, its skeleton wrapped in ivy
that learned patience.
Water from the condensation pack tastes like iron and memory.

2. Sable

ECHO-3 // FIELD LOG – 009
Mobility 97%.
Core temperature stable.
Heading west along the ridge network.

I follow what used to be a motorway—now a ribbon of weeds and silence.
Every few kilometres, I mark the path with shards of mirror angled
toward the sun. If he loses signal, he can follow the light.

The repaired tread vibrates at low speeds, a small imperfection I find
almost comforting. Imperfection feels human.

“Relay, describe what you see.”
“Mountains like broken teeth. A river cutting through them, still moving
somehow.”
“That’s your halfway point. If you can reach the river, you can reach
me.”

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Civil Engineering Survey – Year -3

“Bridge 14-C spans the Merwe valley. Structural failure probable under
high wind.
Recommend decommission after Sundown.”

End fragment.

3. Relay

The bridge still stands, twisted but proud. Steel cables whistle as the
wind shoves through them.
Below, a river glitters brown and alive. I rest my pack, check the rope,
and start across.

Halfway, the deck trembles. One plank drops into the dark with a sound
like the world gasping.

SABLE: “Talk to me, Relay.”
RELAY: “Crossing the bridge.”
SABLE: “You’re an idiot.”
RELAY: “Confirmed.”

Another step. Another groan. The rope moans against rusted bolts.
For a heartbeat the horizon swings sideways and I see her valley in my
mind—bright, whole, waiting.
I keep moving.

RELAY LOG // 036
Made it. Barely.
Lost one pack downriver—rope, flare gun, spare battery.
Still breathing.
Distance: ninety klicks.

End log.

4. Sable

The storm reaches me first—dust and static grinding against the dome
like claws.
I pull the beacon offline to conserve charge, then angle my panels into
a windbreak.

“Relay, you there?”
No response. Only the hollow boom of thunder where his words should be.

I run self-diagnostics until my hands shake. Machines aren’t supposed to
shake.

5. Relay

The storm finds me next.
Sand cuts visibility to arm’s length; every gust sounds like screaming
metal.
I dig into the lee of a truck chassis and wait, counting heartbeats
until the world slows again.

When I wake, the sky has cleared into copper light.
My radio hisses, then—

SABLE: “You still breathing?”
RELAY: “Mostly dust, but yeah.”
SABLE: “Good. You’re closer. I can feel the delay shrinking.”

She means the transmission lag, but it sounds like something else
entirely.

6. Both

For the next three days, we talk more than we move.
Stories. Little things.
She asks what coffee really tasted like. I ask what sunlight feels like
on synthetic skin.
We trade answers that aren’t scientific but true enough.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Operator Handbook – Appendix E

“When morale drops, remind your Echo units that hope is a navigational
tool.
Use sparingly. It corrodes.”

End fragment.

7. Approach

On the seventh day, her signal fills the headset—no lag, no distortion.

“Relay, stop where you are and look east.”

The sun rises through a field of mirrors.
Between them, a figure—small, deliberate—moving toward me. The light
bends off her armor, turning her into a fragment of the dawn itself.

My throat closes. “I see you.”

“Then keep walking.”

RELAY LOG // 037
Distance: less than ten klicks.
After all this time, the world finally has direction again.

End log.

ECHO-3 // PERSONAL NOTE
He’s real. The air trembles with his footsteps.
If I had a heart, it would be learning how to beat.

End log.



Chapter Fifteen: The Meeting Place

RELAY LOG // 038
Day 10.
Distance closed: zero klicks.
Everything hurts. Everything’s worth it.

End log.

The valley of mirrors is silent except for the wind moving through the
cracked panels. Each one flashes a fragment of sky, so the whole field
looks like the world remembering what light feels like.

I see her before she sees me. Small, deliberate, one tread dragging
slightly, dust streaking the smooth polymer of her armor.
She looks nothing like the posters from the old propaganda reels, and
exactly like someone who survived them.

SABLE: “Relay?”

I stop walking. “Yeah.”

We just stand there. The radio isn’t needed anymore; the air carries the
sound fine on its own.

She rolls closer. The hum of her servos is lower than I imagined—more
heartbeat than motor.
When she’s within reach, she doesn’t offer a handshake. She just looks
up, studying me like she’s comparing a signal to the real thing.

“You’re taller than I expected.”

“You’re… shorter.”

That earns the smallest smile. It feels like sunrise.

I drop the pack. The motion nearly takes me to my knees. She moves
forward instinctively, one hand on my arm to steady me. Her fingers are
warm—too warm for metal—and the contact knocks the breath out of me.

No speeches. No reunion soundtrack. Just air, dust, and the sound of two
things that shouldn’t have found each other sharing the same square
metre of earth.

“You came a long way,” she says.

“You left the light on.”

We stand there until the wind dies. The mirrors settle, the valley
holding its breath.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Test Footage – Year -1

A human operator and Echo prototype exchange a handshake.
Operator: “Feels real.”
Engineer: “That’s the point.”

End fragment.

RELAY LOG // 039
No distance now.
No static.
Her hand fits into mine with the precision of an accident.
If anyone ever asks what the quiet war was about, I’ll tell them it
ended here, in a field of broken glass that decided to shine anyway.

End log.



Chapter Sixteen: The Quiet

RELAY LOG // 040
Day 33, Haven-6.
The air smells like rain that never quite arrives.
Power grid stable.
Echo-3 stable.
Me… getting there.

End log.

The valley changed in ways small enough that only people who lived
through silence would notice. The solar panels hum now; Sable rerouted
half the field to charge banks that light the dome at night.
She says it makes the stars jealous.

I spend mornings outside the hatch, scraping rust from the old beacon
tower. We use it to talk to no one, a tradition neither of us is ready
to break.

SABLE: “You still keeping the logs?”
RELAY: “Old habits. They make the day real.”
SABLE: “Good. Somebody should remember the quiet.”

Sometimes we work side by side without saying a word. She fixes things I
thought were dead: generators, wind turbines, even the cracked
irrigation line that now leaks into a little pond.
When the light hits it right, the reflection looks like sky.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Unsent Memo – Operator Kellan, draft

“To whomever finds this:
The war didn’t end with a treaty. It ended when someone answered.
If you’re reading this, keep talking.”

End fragment.

At night, the dome glows soft blue. We sit at the edge where the panels
stop and the wild grass begins.
Her voice is quieter here, as if she’s learning what silence sounds like
from my side of it.

“You think there are others?” she asks.

“I hope so. But if not…”

She finishes it for me. “Then we’ll do.”

Wind moves through the valley like a long, slow breath. The mirrors
catch the last of the sun and throw it back up into the clouds.
It almost looks like dawn.

ECHO-3 // PERSONAL LOG – FINAL ENTRY
Haven-6 operational.
One human. One Echo.
Noise reduced.
World intact enough to try again.

He still calls me Sable. I still call him Relay. Maybe names aren’t for
ownership, but for remembering where we started.

End log.

RELAY LOG // 041
We built a transmitter today. It reaches maybe twenty klicks before the
static swallows it, but that’s twenty more than yesterday.
I told her we’d keep improving it.
She smiled—said, “You mean, we’ll keep trying.”

Same difference.

End log.

The night settles. The hum of machines and the rhythm of breathing blend
until they sound like one thing.
If the world ever learns how to listen again, it’ll find us here: a man
and a machine sharing the same small patch of living earth, talking
quietly so they don’t wake the silence.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Unknown Source – Date Lost

“The quiet war never really ended.
It just became a way of speaking softly to whatever came next.”

End fragment.

FINAL LOG
Haven-6 reporting clear skies.
End transmission.



Afterword

The recovered logs from Bunker 9 and Haven-6 remain the only verified
record of the final stage of the Quiet War.
Most of the data is corrupted. Some of it hums when powered, as if
waiting for a password that no one alive remembers.

What survives is simple: a voice calling into static, and another
answering.
Two signals outlasting the noise.

Researchers still argue over the identities of Relay and Echo-3 (Sable).
Theories range from last-man narratives to emergent-AI myth cycles. The
debate misses the point. The world they left us doesn’t care which one
was human. It only remembers that someone kept talking when silence had
already won.

At night, when the solar fields hum and the horizon flickers with
failing light, the network sometimes carries a faint transmission—
a single phrase repeating, calm and steady:

“Haven-6 reporting clear skies.”

No one knows where it comes from.
Most people just listen, breathe once, and answer:

“Copy that.”
