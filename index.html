RELAY LOG // 001
Bunker 9 still isn’t dead. Close, but not dead.
Main array hums like a fridge from the eighties. Backup inverter coughs every hour on the hour like it’s smoking behind the bike sheds. I re-soldered the seven-bravo coupler with wire stripped off a busted coffee maker because engineering departments don’t send care packages to people they forgot existed.
Breakfast: cold beans with the personality of wet paper.
Mood: “cheerfully circling the drain.”

Weather topside is theoretical. The barometer needle keeps trying to leave its body.

Ran a sweep across the bands. Static, static, a numbers station ghost muttering bedtime math, then a burst that might have been somebody’s heartbeat or just the grid remembering it used to be alive. I pretended not to care, because that’s how you get the universe to call you back.

End log.

The bunker breathes. Not like a person—more like an animal in hibernation, muscles twitching in sleep. Cables hang like ribs exposed. The room smells of dust baked into metal. I keep my jacket on even underground. The concrete keeps last winter like a grudge.

I pull the mic closer. The plastic is cracked where my thumb sits. I’ve worn it in with the same nervous circle: press, talk, release, wait for God.

“Seven-bravo live test,” I say, because ritual is what you do when science and religion have both left the chat. “One, two—”

The room fills with snow. Not the pretty kind. The kind you get when the sky forgets itself.

Then: a voice. Not a person—no, that’s not fair—someone, but carried on a wire, shaped by code. Young, bright, sanded at the edges by interference.

“—y there— Relay? This is Echo-Three. Visibility: a polite ‘no.’ Please tell me somebody’s home.”

I sit up so fast the chair skates. Knee hits locker. The pain is ecstatic; proof I didn’t die and keep working out of habit.

“Echo-Three, I read you,” I say. Calm, professional, the way the manuals used to want. “Signal is dirty but intelligible. Confirm ops status.”

“Uh, define operational.” A hitch of laughter. “Left tread welded itself into modern art. Optics think rain is a religious experience. Battery… optimistic. Morale subroutines are still singing. Please advise.”

I don’t breathe for three seconds. Then I’m already at the patch panel, nudging gain, looking at the green heartbeat line on the ancient scope like it’s a pulse under skin.

“Reduce transmitter gain six percent. You’re peaking. Route through your low-power path. Save your lungs.”

“Copy. Six percent. Low-power path.” The static thins. Her voice comes forward, warmer. “Thanks. That’s better. You often this attentive, or am I special?”

“Everyone’s special until their carrier drops.” The old gallows humor slips out like I never quit it. “Callsign?”

“Sable.” Beat of pride under the word. “Echo-Three, Sable. Recon-light platform, model nine. You can call me ‘you there,’ if that helps morale.”

“Relay,” I say. “You can call me Relay.”

“Noted, Relay.” She tests the name like a coin between teeth. “I’m under a bridge near what used to be Rotterdam. Smells like someone set a river on fire. Again.”

I pull a map off the wall. The paper is soft from being folded too many times. I find the ruin of Rotterdam by habit, not hope. Pencil marks spiderweb across margins: old routes, signals that died mid-syllable. I put a new dot where Sable might be.

“Telemetry?”

“Telemetry is shy. I’ve got wind, water, and a taste of the industrial apocalypse. Oh, and my own footsteps, which is adorable because I don’t have feet.”

“You’ve got treads,” I remind her.

“Semantics, Relay. I’m five feet tall with delusions of grandeur.”

Five feet. Three-quarter height by design. You could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them and feel like an older sibling, not a god. Stronger than they looked. You learned that lesson once and never relearned it.

ARCHIVE FRAGMENT // Recruiting Spot B-roll, Year -2
They file through a mess tent, polymer skin catching desert light like it remembers water. Helmets under one arm, faces open in that way nothing human ever is. A corporal jokes badly; the Echo smiles perfectly and hands him a cup that tastes like real coffee. Cameras catch soldiers pretending not to stare. The Echo’s laugh lands where pain used to live.
Slogan: “You’ll never feel alone.”
Someone in command circles it in red and writes, Approved.
